# Project 1 - Hello World

This assignment is intended to serve as a warm up assignment. We will make sure
that all the correct tools are installed and then we will write the traditional
[Hello World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)

## Important Links

- Review the [grading rubric](https://shanepanter.com/cs452/grading-rubric.html)

## Tools

This project requires bash (git bash), cmake, and a C++17 compliant compiler
(GCC, Clang, VC++). All of these tools are already installed on the cs lab
machines for you to use.

### Remote Development (Optional)

There is a way to do remote development using GitHub Codespaces as described
[here](https://shanepanter.com/teaching/vscode-tips-and-tricks.html#_developing_remotely_codespaces).
Codespaces is unsupported by your instructor and only provided for those brave
enough to venture out of the lab environment ðŸ˜ƒ.

âš  Be aware that Codespaces only gives you 60 hrs free per month so if you choose
to use Codespaces you may incur some additional costs. The Kount Computer
Tutoring Center (CCP 241) is accessible 24/7 by proxy card to all students
enrolled in CS courses. Machines in the Kount Computer Tutoring Center have all
the software you will need this semester.

## CMake

We will be using CMake in this class. Once CMake is installed it should
automatically  detect your compiler and then enable or disable features base on
what is installed. For example this project will compile with `gcc` but not be
able to take advantage of the address sanitizers that clang has.

- [cmake](https://cmake.org/)
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)

## Task 1 - Write Hello World

Open the file `main.cpp` and write a main function that outputs "Hello World!"
as described in class.

## Task 2 - Generate Build Files

There are two scripts in the root directory named `clean.sh` and `release.sh`.
One creates a release build to compile your project and the other will delete
all the temporary files that are created during the build process.

Run the `release.sh` script from the terminal to setup your project. Note
that your output will be slightly different than what is shown below because
cmake configures the build system specific to the system that it is running on.

```bash
[shanepanter@onyx os-starter]$ ./setup.sh

## Task 3 - Compile your code

After you have run `release.sh` you can `cd` into the build directory to compile
and run the program.

```bash
[shanepanter@onyx os-starter]$ cd build/
[shanepanter@onyx build]$ make
Scanning dependencies of target lab
[  7%] Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/lab.dir/lab.cpp.o
[ 14%] Linking CXX shared library ../liblab.so
[ 14%] Built target lab
Scanning dependencies of target myprogram
[ 21%] Building CXX object src/CMakeFiles/myprogram.dir/main.cpp.o
[ 28%] Linking CXX executable ../myprogram
[ 100%] Built target myprogram
```

If your code that you wrote in task 1 was correct you should see a executable
named `myprogram` that you can now run to see the output. If your program did
not compile you will need to return to task 1 and fix your code and then return
to this task to compile your code again. You only need to run the `release.sh`
script once if you are recompiling you can skip Task 2 above.

## Task 4 - Complete the Retrospective

Once you have completed all the tasks open the file **Retrospective.md** and
complete each section that has a TODO label.

For the **Experience** section you need to detail your experience with this lab.

- Were there any things that you struggled with?
- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified?
- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs
that you have in your code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you
couldn't figure out why. If your code doesn't have any issues you can simply
write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of
the textbook or course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed
that you didn't use google at all. Be safe CITE!

## Task 5 - Add, Commit, Push your code

Once you are finished you need to make sure that you have pushed all your code
to GitHub for grading! You will not be submitting anything to canvas everything
will be submitted through GitHub as demonstrated in class.
